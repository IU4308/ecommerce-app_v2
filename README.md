# ðŸš€ Ecommerce App v2 build as a custom PHP MVC Framework  

This project is a refactored version of the ecommerce-app project, rewritten as a **PHP MVC framework** using practices inspired by The Codeholicâ€™s MVC framework tutorial project. The framework has been extended to implement all the features of the original project while improving code structure, maintainability, and scalability.  

## âœ¨ Features  
- Custom-built **PHP MVC framework**, extending Codeholicâ€™s approach  
- Clear separation of concerns (Models, Views, Controllers)  
- Modular and reusable class architecture  
- Encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism implementation  
- Improved performance and maintainability
